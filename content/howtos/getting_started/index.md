## Find your filament

Goto [Producers](/producers) and select your producer, material and the filament by name. At the moment we don't offer different colors. Maybe we will extend the filament selection sometimes by a color palette.

Each filament can be accesed by a shorter link, this link is used for QR-Code generation.

When you miss one of your producers or materials or filaments, see the [contribute](../contribute.md) page for more information.
